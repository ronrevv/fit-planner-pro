# Agent Rules

## Core Directives
1.  **Do not alter existing functionality unless explicitly instructed by the user.**
    -   This is a strict rule. Prioritize adding new features or fixing specific bugs without modifying unrelated existing logic or behavior.
    -   If a requested change requires modifying existing functionality, explicitly ask for user confirmation before proceeding, unless the user's prompt clearly implies the modification.
